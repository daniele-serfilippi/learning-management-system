# Security Policy for [Learning Management System]

## Introduction
This document outlines the security policy for the [21XO-LMS] repository. Our goal is to maintain the highest standards of security to protect the data and integrity of the system. We appreciate contributions from the community and encourage reporting of any security vulnerabilities discovered.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:
- **Confidentiality**: Report vulnerabilities by getting in touch per the listed contact options on [https://21xo.com](https://21xo.com/) or sending an email to [xofidelius@proton.me](mailto:xofidelius@proton.me). Please do not report security vulnerabilities publicly.
- **Details**: Include as much information as possible about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce, potential impact, and any suggestions for mitigation.
- **Response**: We aim to respond to your report within 48 hours and will keep you informed throughout the process.

## Security Update Process
Our team regularly monitors for security issues and ensures that they are addressed promptly. The process includes:
- **Monitoring**: Regular scanning for vulnerabilities in dependencies and code.
- **Updating**: Prompt updates to dependencies and patches to our code when vulnerabilities are identified.
- **Notification**: We will notify users of significant security issues through [GitHub Issues, the project’s mailing list, etc.].

## Dependencies Management
To maintain the security of the LMS, we adhere to the following practices:
- **Regular Audits**: Conducting periodic audits of third-party dependencies for known security issues.
- **Automated Scanning**: Utilizing tools like [Snyk, Dependabot] for automatic detection of vulnerable dependencies.
- **Timely Updates**: Ensuring dependencies are kept up-to-date to mitigate security vulnerabilities.

## Data Protection Measures
We prioritize the protection of sensitive data, especially given the nature of an educational LMS. Our measures include:
- **Encryption**: Ensuring data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- **Access Control**: Implementing strict access controls and permissions for data access.
- **Data Minimization**: Collecting only the data necessary for the functionality of the LMS.
- **Regular Audits**: Conducting regular audits to ensure compliance with data protection standards.

## Contributing to Security
We welcome and encourage contributions that improve the security of the LMS. If you have suggestions or improvements, please submit a pull request or open an issue.
